Feature: Take attendance for a Face to face with multiple sessions
  Ensure that the correct session is being used to mark activity completion when a face to face has multiple sessions
  To test whether the old or new session date is the current completion date, we run cron, and the older date will expire,
  whereas the newer date will merely open the recert window.

  Background:
    Given I am on a totara site

    And the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email             |
      | user1    | first1    | last1    | user1@example.com |
    And the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname | enablecompletion |
      | course1  | course1   | 1                |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user  | course  | role           |
      | user1 | course1 | student        |

    # Create the face to face.
    And I log in as "admin"
    And I follow "course1"
    And I turn editing mode on
    And I add the "Course completion status" block
    And I add a "Face-to-face" to section "1" and I fill the form with:
      | Name                                    | facetoface1                                       |
